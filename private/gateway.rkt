Architecture:
- Every ws-client instance represents one shard, and is associated with one permanently
running master thread that is only terminated when the entire shard is stopped.
- Every ws-client is further associated with at most one receive thread and at most
one heartbeater thread at all times. These threads are treated as cheap and transient.
- Whenever the receive thread or heartbeater thread notice something is wrong, they send
a pair '("error msg" . resumable) to the master thread via the stop-channel.
- When the master thread notices either a value on the stop-channel (one of the threads
asked to reconnect), or one of the threads died (unexpected crash), it will clean up,
close the socket, sleep briefly, then start another connection.
- If the error is specified to be nonresumable, the session and sequence numbers are cleared to force
a fresh IDENTIFY handshake instead of a RESUME next reconnection.
- The ws-client does not hold onto its master thread, the caller (upper level discord client)
is the one responsible for terminating it by sending it a break.
